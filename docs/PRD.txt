Product Requirements Document (PRD) for DocuID Office Add-in

Version: 1.1
Date: 18 June 2025

1. Overview

Goal:
To build a Microsoft Office Add-in named DocuID that allows users to securely authenticate via the iVALT biometric system (through the DocuID backend) and access a personalized panel displaying documents they are authorized to view or open.

Target Applications:
- Microsoft Word

Platform Support:
- Windows
- macOS

2. Core Features

Authentication
- User logs in using their mobile number with country code.
- Authentication is handled via Docuid.net, which integrates with iVALT for biometric verification on the user's registered device.
- The backend verifies if the user exists or needs to be created.
- Response includes a session token and user profile.

Document Access Panel
- After authentication, the user sees a panel inside the Office Add-in.
- The panel fetches and displays a list of documents available to the user from the backend.
- Each document entry includes:
  - Title
  - Type (e.g., PDF, DOCX)
  - Last modified date
  - Open/View button

Document Opening
- Clicking "Open" loads the document either:
  - Directly into the Office app (if supported),
  - Or triggers a download,
  - Or opens in an embedded viewer.

3. User Flow

The user flow is detailed in the diagram below.

5. Technical Requirements

Frontend (Office Add-in)
- Scaffolding: yo office (Office Add-in generator)
- Framework: React.js
- API: Office.js (Office JavaScript API) for integration with Host applications.
- Styling: HTML, CSS.
- Hosting: Hosted on a public HTTPS server.

Backend
- Service: Docuid.net
- Functionality: Provides REST APIs for:
  - User authentication (integrating with iVALT).
  - Fetching the document list for authenticated users.
  - Retrieving document content or a secure URL for viewing/downloading.

Authentication
- The add-in communicates with Docuid.net for authentication.
- Docuid.net handles the iVALT integration for biometric verification.
- Session management is token-based.

Storage
- Cloud storage for user-specific document access (e.g., AWS S3 API), managed by the backend.
