# AI Assistant Rules

## Code Style Guidelines

### Prohibited Elements

- **No Emojis**: Never use emojis in code, comments, commit messages, or PR descriptions
- Use descriptive text instead of emojis for clarity and professionalism

### Commit Messages

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep descriptions clear and professional without emojis

### Pull Request Descriptions

- Use markdown formatting for structure
- Use bullet points and headers for organization
- Avoid emojis - use clear, professional language

### Code Comments

- Write clear, descriptive comments
- Explain "why" not "what" when the code is self-explanatory
- No decorative elements or emojis

## Example

**Bad:**
```
git commit -m "feat: add login form 🎉"
```

**Good:**
```
git commit -m "feat: add biometric login form with phone input"
```
